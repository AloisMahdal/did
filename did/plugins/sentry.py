Sentry stats such as commented, resolved issues

Configuration example::

    [sentry]
    type = sentry
    url = http://sentry.usersys.redhat.com/api/0/
    token = a1s2d3f4a1s2d3f4a1s2d3f4a1s2d3f4a1s2d3f4

You need to generate authentication token
at http://sentry.usersys.redhat.com/api/.
The only scope you need to check is `org:read`.
